1. You can only crash if all champs are picked. Not hovered, actual picked!
2. You can't crash after the cooldown for the game to start passed 15 seconds.
3. When crashing, you will end in a custom game. Wait until you went ingame and then just quit.

Everyone who was in champ select will just be back to lobby. You can open a lobby again and straight queue up again.
